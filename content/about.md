Hello, I'm Amjad Alsharafi.

I'm a reverse engineer and malware researcher at work.

I also enjoy:
- programming especially low-level/performance stuff like emulators and OSes.
- CTFs, I mostly do reverse :D
- Chess.

Some projects I have worked on (open source):
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [plastic] | NES emulator, it was the first real emulator I built, still works well. Got it to work on android through `ffi` which was interesting journey.
| [mizu] | GB emulator focusing on accuracy, performed better than some popular emulators on tests, This has less UI support than [plastic] done by me, but the API is very easy to use and can be embedded anywhere since it just uses arrays to store images and so on. Let me know if you used it somewhere :D
| [PSX] |  Work on progress PSX emulator, its still in progress and doesn't play everything, but still plays a lot of games and has all the features including GPU, MDEC and sound, only missing some bug fixes here and there. This got me into GPU programming since I was uing `Vulkan` as a backend renderer, I was using [vulkano], and also got some PRs merged into it to fix some issues.
| [OS] | latest creation, an operating system from scratch. Exploring the design and implementation of kernels, talking to hardware. managing memory/disk, and more.
