Hello, I'm Amjad Alsharafi.

I'm a software engineer, and malware researcher.

Please checkout my [cv](/cv.pdf).

I also enjoy:
- programming especially low-level/performance stuff like emulators and OSes.
- CTFs, I mostly do reverse :D
- Chess.

Look at my [projects](/projects) to see what I have been working on.
